# 1D-LW-ResNet: High-Efficiency UAV Detector Based on RF Signals

## Introduction

1d_lw_ResNet is a simplified version of the ResNet network for the task of classifying and identifying RF signals from UAVs. Our work found that the feature distribution obtained along the frequency dimension in the spectrogram is more sparse, so we used a one-dimensional frequency vector as the input to the network, and changed ResNet to a one-dimensional network as well, which greatly reduces the number of parameters, and with the original Compared with the original method, this project guarantees the same accuracy and greatly reduces the number of parameters.

## Requirements

1. Install `pytorch` and `torchvision` (we use `pytorch>=1.13.0` and `torchvision>=0.14.0`).
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Run
### Download Processed Data

We used dataset form [DroneRFa](https://jeit.ac.cn/web/data/getData?dataType=Dataset3).

For these time-domain signal datasets, we use the STFT transform to convert them into spectrograms.
